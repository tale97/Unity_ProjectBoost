# Rocket Launcher (Project Boost)

## Description

A simple 3D game where you control a rocket using SPACE (to thrust) and left/right arrow keys to navigate. Your goal is to reach the landing pad while avoiding colliding into dangerous red obstacles. There are 6 levels of difficulty. This game was made using Unity Engine and inspired from Ben Tristem's awesome Udemy Course, called [Complete C# Unity Game Developer 3D](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WeyAkYddltSQXo=/).

## About The Project
This is a project that I have been worked on more than a year ago. The reason I wanted to do this was because I wanted to explore game development. I learned a lot and had so much fun creating this game. I really recommend the course by Ben Tristem's [Complete C# Unity Game Developer 3D](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WeyAkYddltSQXo=/) to anyone who is insterested in learning game development.
